# VCDF: A Validated Consensus Driven Framework for Time Series Causal Discovery

This repository contains the implementation of VCDF (Validated Consensus Driven Framework) for time series causal discovery, along with its applications and experimental validations.

## Project Overview

The VCDF framework extends traditional causal discovery methods by incorporating k-fold validation and robustness checks, significantly improving the reliability of causal structure identification in time series data. This project demonstrates the framework's effectiveness through applications with VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI methods, and provides comprehensive experimental validation.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains real and synthetic datasets used in experiments.
- `results/`: Stores experimental results and analysis.
- `src/`: Source code for the VCDF framework and method implementations.
  - `vcdf.py`: Core implementation of the Validated Consensus Driven Framework
  - `run_causal_discovery.py`: Implementation of various causal discovery methods (VAR-LiNGAM, PCMCI, TCDF, Dynotears) and VCDF extensions for VAR-LiNGAM and PCMCI
  - `causal_matrix_evaluation.py`: Utilities for evaluating causal matrices
  - `models/`: External model implementations (VAR-LiNGAM, PCMCI, TCDF)
- `*.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks for running experiments and analysis.

## Key Components

1. VCDF Framework Implementation (`src/vcdf.py`)
   - Generic VCDF implementation applicable to various causal discovery methods
   - Grid search functionality for parameter optimization
   - Robust validation and adjustment procedures
   - Standard K-fold splitting with alternative time series aware option

2. Causal Discovery Methods (`src/run_causal_discovery.py`)
   - Base implementations: VAR-LiNGAM, PCMCI, TCDF, Dynotears, VAR-LiNGAM Bootstrap
   - VCDF extensions: VCDF-VAR-LiNGAM, VCDF-PCMCI
   - Utility functions for matrix manipulation and evaluation

3. Experimental Components
   - Synthetic dataset generator (`data/synthetic/generate_synthetic_data.ipynb`)
   - Experimental notebooks for synthetic and fMRI data (`run_experiments_*.ipynb`)
   - Application examples and case studies

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment (Python 3.8-3.10 recommended):
   ```bash
   python3.10 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks to reproduce experiments or use the framework

### Example Usage

```python
from src.run_causal_discovery import run_vcdf_varlingam, run_vcdf_pcmci

# Run VCDF-VARLiNGAM
results = run_vcdf_varlingam(data, n_splits=5)

# Run VCDF-PCMCI
results = run_vcdf_pcmci(data, n_splits=7)
